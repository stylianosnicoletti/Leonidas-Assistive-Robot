# Leonidas-Assistive-Robot

Leonidas is an assistant robot constructed with Lego pieces. Since elderly people respond better
to robots than tablets, we have programmed Leo to play interactive games that they would
normally play on a tablet. This helps them maintain their cognitive fitness as it tests their memory
and reaction times for the games. Leo has the ability to move his arms. As a user, you are expected
to press the buttons on the arms indicated by the corresponding LEDs lighting up. Leo has the
Amazon Alexa integrated into its system, which allows users to speak to it and choose games verbally.
The reason for using both the Alexa and button pressing as an interaction mechanism between the
user and Leo is that people benefit from congruent multi-sensory information. Leo also has face
detection and table edge detection abilities which make sure it faces the user and doesnâ€™t fall off the
table.
